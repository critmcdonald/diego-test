        <p>This collection of photos includes photos of me during important moments of my life as well as photos I have taken myself. While photography is not my main hobby, I enjoy learning about framing techniques and being able to tell a story through a single image. That said, what I have learned through photography has influenced my work as a videographer, and I am sure I still have much to learn!</p>
