            DISCLAIMER. This is the opinion of someone who has coded and taken
            classes mainly in Python. That said, I have also coded in Java,
            JavaScript and R, so this blog aims to offer advice to people
            learning to code for the first time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whether you are curious about data analysis or need it for a
            specific application, many people will direct you to learn either
            <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> or
            <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> as a good first language
            because of their support for advanced statistics and relatively
            simple syntax. But which one should you learn, and why?
          </p>

          <p>
            The most important factor in your decision should be what you plan
            to do outside of data analysis, if you plan on doing anything
            outside of it at all. Choose R if you are interested strictly in
            data analysis or a quick way to do advanced statistics with little
            setup. However, choose Python if you want to do more than just data
            analysis, such as building websites or developing software (though
            this is not to say this cannot be done in R).
          </p>

          <p>
            The blog could end here for most readers, but maybe a few more
            reasons could influence your decision. If you prefer to have a
            larger community of support to help troubleshoot your coding issues,
            choose Python. While the R community continues to grow in membership
            because of the popularity of big data and artificial intelligence,
            Python consistently ranks at the top with other programming
            languages like
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/c/c_intro.php">C</a>,
            <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/">Java</a> and
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript"
              >JavaScript</a
            >
            for its versatility. Nonetheless, both Python and R have robust
            libraries capable of making your time with data much easier than
            otherwise.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, Python lacks the ease with which someone can pick up R,
            install the
            <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">Tidyverse</a> packages, and
            immediately begin manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data. The
            <a href="https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/articles/manifesto.html"
              >tidy tools manifesto</a
            >
            leaves a sense of simplicity and cohesion often lacking from
            Python's overwhelming number of packages, which can vary immensely
            in form and usage. While package managers like
            <a href="https://anaconda.org/anaconda/conda">Conda</a> streamline
            this process in Python, it requires more installation steps than R’s
            Tidyverse.

            Despite their similarities and differences, one thing is sure: As
            interpreted languages, Python and R are slow! Be prepared to wait
            several minutes for specific scripts to run with large datasets,
            especially if they involve machine learning. Coding to reduce
            <a

              >time complexity</a
            >, or the rate at which time increases as the data inputted into the
            algorithm rises, is an art in itself. But that’s for another blog
            post!
