                        I am a student journalist pursuing my Bachelor of
                        Journalism and an Elements of Computing certificate at
                        the University of Texas at Austin. With my technical
                        knowledge and love for writing, I seek to serve my
                        community by telling impactful multimedia stories that
                        adhere to the truth and allow people to receive the
                        information they need.

                        Right now I am particularly interested in exploring the

                        When applying for college, I struggled to choose a major
                        to consistently apply with because various degrees
                        interested me in one way or another. Every choice made
                        me feel as though I had to either sacrifice my love for
                        reading and writing or my love for technology and
                        science. So, when I had the option to apply for both a
                        primary and backup major, I decided to apply for both
                        computer science and journalism, and I was acceepted
                        subsequently into Moody College of Communication's
                        journalism program.

                      <p>
                        For some reason, I thought that this meant I would never
                        look at code again or be able to combine my interests in
                        any meaningful way. It was not until I began to study
                        journalism further, however, that I realized an entire
                        data journalism community existed of people like me who
                        loved both storytelling and programming. Since then, I
                        have sought to learn as much as I can about how I can
                        use data analysis and computational techniques to
                        augment different forms of news content to feel more
                        engaging and authentic for audiences.

                For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a feature story,
                which I decided to do on a local student artist named Luis
                Hernandez (a.k.a. &quot;Martin Leon&quot;), who is signed to
                UTalent Records, an independent student label located at UT. For
                this feature, I conducted extensive interviews with Leon, his
                band, the UTalent team, and audience members at one of his
                performances. It was an honor to learn more about independent
                student artists at UT and be able to tell an artist&#39;s story.

                Working with fellow Texan videographers Jane Goldberg and
                Miranda Liguez, we filmed The Project 2024, UT Austin&#39;s
                biggest day of service. To cover more ground during the hours
                the event lasted, I helped Goldberg and Liguez with filming the

                For this assignment, I was tasked with writing a story about how
                government bodies and public policy affect real people. I wrote
                about the Austin City Council&#39;s decision to co-sponsor
                beloved concert series Blues on the Green, initially canceled by
                ACL Radio due to a lack of funding, and what the concert&#39;s
                return meant for local musicians and citizens. I found an
                overwhelming demand by artists for the city further to support
                its music scene amidst rising living costs. For this story, I
                attended an Austin City Council meeting in person, communicated
                with the team of councilmember Natasha Harper-Madison and spoke
                with musicians to hear their opinions about the subject.

                Waller Creek and the Waller Creek watershed are essential
                features for UT and Austin, but not enough students seem to know
